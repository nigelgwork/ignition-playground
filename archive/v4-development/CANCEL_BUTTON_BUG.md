# Cancel Button Not Working - Investigation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Current Version**: 3.44.12
**Status**: ⚠️ UNRESOLVED - Needs immediate attention

## The Problem

The Cancel button in the execution detail page (top right, above Live browser view) **does not stop running executions**. User can click it, it responds visually, but the execution continues running to completion.

User reports this was working perfectly yesterday and somehow got broken.

## What We've Investigated

### 1. Frontend Cancel Button (✅ WORKING)
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/ExecutionControls.tsx`
- **Status**: Button IS sending POST requests to `/api/executions/{id}/cancel`
- **Evidence**: Server logs show `POST /api/executions/{id}/cancel HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
- **Fix Applied**: Added `useRef` to prevent React re-render race conditions (v3.44.11)

### 2. Backend Cancel Endpoint (✅ WORKING)
- **File**: `ignition_toolkit/api/routers/executions.py` lines 871-905
- **Status**: Endpoint IS being called and returns 200 OK
- **Actions**:
  - Sets cancel signal in engine: `await engine.cancel()` ✅
  - Should cancel asyncio task: `task.cancel()` ❓ (may not be reaching this)

### 3. WebSocket Stability (✅ FIXED)
- **Issue**: WebSocket connections dropping during long steps (30-60s)
- **Fix Applied**: v3.44.10 - Server keepalive every 15s, client ping every 15s
- **Status**: Connections now stay alive, but this doesn't affect cancellation

### 4. The Actual Bug (❌ UNRESOLVED)

**Current Hypothesis**: Task is being removed from `active_tasks` dictionary BEFORE cancel is called.

**Evidence**:
- Line 538 in `executions.py`: Task is removed in `finally` block
- This `finally` block runs even if task is still executing
- When cancel endpoint tries to get the task, it's already gone
- Without the task reference, we can't call `task.cancel()` to interrupt execution

**Symptom User Reported**:
> "I saw it cancel the execution for like 1 sec and then the execution went back to running"

This suggests:
1. Cancel signal IS being set (`engine.cancel()` works)
2. Engine checks the signal and pauses briefly
3. But something resumes it immediately

**Server logs show multiple RESUME requests**:
```
POST /api/executions/{id}/resume HTTP/1.1 200 OK
POST /api/executions/{id}/resume HTTP/1.1 200 OK
POST /api/executions/{id}/resume HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

These resume requests happen AFTER cancellation!

## Diagnostic Logging Added (v3.44.12)

Added extensive logging in `executions.py` cancel endpoint:
```python
logger.info(f"Cancel signal set for execution {execution_id}")

if execution_id in active_tasks:
    logger.info(f"✅ Cancelling asyncio Task for execution {execution_id}")
    task.cancel()
else:
    logger.warning(f"❌ Execution {execution_id} NOT in active_tasks! Cannot cancel task. Keys: {list(active_tasks.keys())}")
```

## What to Check Tomorrow

1. **Start execution and click Cancel**
2. **Check server logs** for:
   - `✅ Cancelling asyncio Task` → Task found (good)
   - `❌ Execution NOT in active_tasks` → Task missing (this is the bug!)
3. **Look for RESUME requests** in logs - why is something auto-resuming?

## Possible Root Causes

### Theory 1: Task Removed Too Early
**Location**: `ignition_toolkit/api/routers/executions.py` line 538
```python
finally:
    # This runs BEFORE task completes!
    if execution_id in active_tasks:
        del active_tasks[execution_id]  # ❌ TOO EARLY!
```

**Fix**: Move task removal to AFTER execution actually completes, not in the wrapper function's finally block.

### Theory 2: Frontend Auto-Resuming
**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/ExecutionDetail.tsx` line 262-264
```typescript
// If currently paused, resume execution when debug mode is turned off
if (execution.status === 'paused') {
    await api.executions.resume(executionId);
}
```

**Issue**: If cancellation briefly sets status to 'paused', debug mode toggle might auto-resume.

**Fix**: Check if status is 'cancelled' before resuming.

### Theory 3: CancelledError Not Propagating
**Location**: `ignition_toolkit/playbook/engine.py`
**Issue**: `CancelledError` might be caught and swallowed somewhere in step execution.

**Fix**: Ensure `CancelledError` propagates all the way up without being caught by generic `except Exception`.

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/ExecutionControls.tsx` - Added useRef for race condition (v3.44.11)
2. `ignition_toolkit/api/routers/executions.py` - Added diagnostic logging (v3.44.12)
3. `ignition_toolkit/api/services/websocket_manager.py` - Added keepalive loop (v3.44.10)
4. `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Reduced ping interval to 15s (v3.44.10)

## Git History

```
2bb0435 - v3.44.12 - Add diagnostic logging for cancel button issue
a46cdf3 - v3.44.11 - Fix cancel button race condition with useRef
2030398 - v3.44.10 - WebSocket stability: Server keepalive + reduced ping interval
3fee1cc - v3.44.9 - Changed cancelled status to grey
```

## Next Steps Tomorrow

1. ✅ Check diagnostic logs to confirm whether task is in active_tasks
2. ⏳ If task is missing: Fix line 538 to NOT remove task until execution completes
3. ⏳ If task is present: Investigate why CancelledError isn't stopping execution
4. ⏳ Find why RESUME requests are being sent after cancellation
5. ⏳ Test cancellation works correctly
6. ⏳ Remove debug logging once fixed
7. ⏳ Bump version to 3.44.13 or 3.45.0 with proper fix

## Important Context

- User emphasized this was working yesterday
- User said "this is never a browser issue" when I suggested clearing cache
- Multiple cancel attempts show same behavior
- Execution continues to completion even after cancel button clicked
- This is the Cancel button in top right of ExecutionDetail page, not any other button

## ✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED (v3.44.13)

**Date Fixed**: 2025-10-31
**Root Cause Confirmed**: Theory 1 was correct - Task removed too early

**The Problem**:
In `ignition_toolkit/api/routers/executions.py` lines 536-538, the task was being removed from `active_tasks` dictionary in the `finally` block of the execution wrapper function. This `finally` block executes immediately after the wrapper sets up the background task, NOT when the task actually completes.

**Before (BROKEN)**:
```python
finally:
    if gateway_client:
        await gateway_client.__aexit__(None, None, None)
    # Clean up task reference
    active_tasks = get_active_tasks()
    if execution_id in active_tasks:
        del active_tasks[execution_id]  # ❌ Removed immediately!
```

**After (FIXED)**:
```python
finally:
    if gateway_client:
        await gateway_client.__aexit__(None, None, None)
    # NOTE: Task cleanup is handled by TTL mechanism, not here
    # Removing task too early prevents cancel endpoint from finding it
```

**Why This Fixes It**:
- Task reference now stays in `active_tasks` for the entire execution duration
- Cancel endpoint can now find the task and call `task.cancel()` to interrupt it
- TTL cleanup mechanism (already in place) handles task removal after 30 minutes
- No memory leak - TTL cleanup prevents accumulation of old tasks

**Files Modified**:
- `ignition_toolkit/api/routers/executions.py` (lines 535-536)

**Testing Required**:
1. Start a long-running playbook execution
2. Click Cancel button during execution
3. Verify execution stops immediately (not after current step)
4. Verify status changes to "cancelled" in UI
5. Verify no errors in server logs

---

**Priority**: ✅ FIXED in v3.44.13
**Complexity**: Low - Simple fix, removed premature cleanup
**Risk**: Low - Existing TTL mechanism handles cleanup properly
